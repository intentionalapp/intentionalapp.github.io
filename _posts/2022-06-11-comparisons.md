The Internet has unlocked tremendous value for everyone. From being a remote worker for a corporation to being a digital nomad working for oneself, we rely heavily on the internet and desktops to achieve our goals. But all too often, we have to navigate through distracting websites to get our work done. Have you ever gone to YouTube to learn about an important concept but then got sucked into a rabbit hole of cat videos? Or been to Facebook to checkout a family friend's photo but got sucked into the distracting News Feed?

It takes a lot of willpower and skill to overcome such distractions, especially when Big Tech spends billions of dollars optimizing their advertisement-based revenue models to capture your attention on their platforms for as long as possible.

We need more tools that help us to do our best work while also allowing us to gain value from powerful platforms like YouTube (like learning content) and Facebook ( like connecting with family and friends).

# Current tools to block distractions


## One-Time Blockers

One-time content blockers block distracting websites forever. They come with a pre-determined list of blocked websites that you can augment manually. These are simple yet effective tools to break distracting habits like procrastinating by going on Twitter or Instagram. However, these are blunt instruments that often inflexible to our complex needs. What happens when you want to go to Twitter to learn about an important concept but are blocked by your tool? In the long run, people disable these blockers since they disable them due to well-intentioned reasons but forget to re-enable them. Instead, we need content blockers that are flexible to our needs and require little manual intervention.

## Timer-based Blockers

Timer-based content blockers are advanced distraction blockers that are flexible to our occasional needs from highly distracting websites. These tools by default block these websites and allow occasional unblocking, but subsequently re-block after a certain time period. The timer-based re-blocking prevents you from forgetting to re-block, guaranteeing that you will use these tools in the long run.

Moreover, all the above tools do not blanket block the entire website, but only the distracting interfaces, like the News Feed or the Recommended Videos panel on the website. This is important since you can still access these websites without disabling the blocker to do important tasks like messaging or searching/viewing an educational video.
